### 1. HTTP
- Where is this protocol defined? [RFC 9112](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9112) [RFC 9113](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9113)
- Client and server use the HTTP protocol to communicate
- Characteristics
	- Stateless protocol
		- Each req/res in HTTP is independent of each other
	- Uses TCP as underlying protocol
- What is defined in the protocol
	- The syntax of the request and responses
	- The semantics 
- Terminology
	- Web page
		- The web page will have multiple objects(HTML, CSS, png, etc.) referenced using URL
	- URL:
		- Defined in [RFC 3986](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986)
		- Short sequence of characters used to identify resources in the internet and locate the resource
			- URLs are a subset of URI, URI are universal resource identifiers
		- URI: used to locate a resource. More generic and not limited to the internet
- What happens when we visit a website?
	- Assume the client already has the server address
	- The client sends a connection request to the web server
	- The server responds with an ack message if it accepts the connection
	- The client sends the request for the base html file
	- The server sends the base html file as response
	- The client receives the base html page and requests the resources that are referenced in the base html page
	- The server sends these resources
#### 1.1 Non persistent TCP connection with no parallel connections
- In HTTP 1.1 non persistent tcp connections were used
- Each object is sent over a separate TCP connection
- HTTP uses three way hand shake 
	- Client -> Server : TCP SYN
	- Server -> Client : TCP SYN ACK
	- Client -> Server : TCP ACK, HTTP Req(piggy backed)
- 1 RTT to establish connection as the third packet is set along with the http request
- 1 RTT + File transmission delay is required to transfer the file
- Total time to receive a file: 2 RTT
#### 1.2 Non persistent TCP connection with parallel TCP connection
- Each object still requires a separate TCP Connection, but multiple TCP connections are established at once 
#### 1.3 Persistent TCP without pipelining  
- Over the same TCP connection multiple objects can be sent
- Each object is sent sequentially
#### 1.4 Persistent TCP with pipelining
- Over the same connection, send multiple requests and responses in burst
- If there 10 objects in the base HTML, client sends 10 requests at once, the server sends all the objects at once 
- Each object is sent in fcfs, only after the object for the first request is sent, the second object can be sent
	 - This is the head of line blocking
	 - If the first object needs to be fetched from another server, the delay to send the first object increases, therefore increasing the delay for subsequent objects
#### 1.5 Persistent TCP with pipelining and parallel connections
- Open multiple parallel persistent TCP connections with pipelining
#### 1.6 HTTP2
- Issues with HTTP 1
	- Head of line blocking
		- In HTTP 1, FCFS is used to send the objects. If the second object is blocked until the first object is received by the client
	- Plain text protocol
		- In HTTP1, the plain text is converted to binary using ascii values
		- This is inefficient
		- Example: For HTTP Method (GET, PUT, POST, DELETE, HEAD), HTTP 1 will convert the GET into asci and send it over the internet
			- Instead we can have a Method binary array: each bit combination will HTTP method, this will be a binary protocol rather than a text protocol
	- Server serves files in FCFS
		- Client cannot set a priority for the object it requests
- HTTP 2 Characteristics
	- Binary protocol
	- Multiplexing and Framing 
		- Head of line blocking is prevented by framing
		- Each obj is split into frames even before sending to the underlying network layer
	- Client can set priorities for the objects it requires 

### 2. Analyzing web performance
#### 2.1. Core web vitals
- Largest Contentful Paint
	- How fast the page is visible in viewport
	- Metrics: 75% of the page loads within 2.5 seconds
	- First Contentful Paint
		- Time from start of request to first content appearing on screen
		- Metric: time should be within 1.8 seconds
	- Render blocking resources
		- Resources that prevent the rendering of the first paint unless the resource is fetched
	- LCP Priority and LCP discoverability
		- Set high priority to LCP content to fetch it first
		- Set discoverability to let the browser to know that the content needs to be rendered first
	- LCP Preloading
	- LCP lazy loading
		- Delay non-critical resources to load later
- Cumulative Layout shift
	- How much the webpage contents move when the page elements are being rendered
- First Input Delay
	- Time taken for user input after the webpage has completely rendered
	- 75% of the navigation takes less than 100 ms
	- Total Blocking time
		- Time between first contentful paint and first input delay
- Interaction to next paint
	- Browser to render the next paint for a given user input 
- Long tasks
	- Scripts that block the main thread that prevents it from receiving user input
