### 1. HTTP
- Where is this protocol defined? [RFC 9112](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9112) [RFC 9113](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9113)
- Client and server use the HTTP protocol to communicate
- Characteristics
	- Stateless protocol
		- Each req/res in HTTP is independent of each other
	- Uses TCP as underlying protocol
- What is defined in the protocol
	- The syntax of the request and responses
	- The semantics 
- Terminology
	- Web page
		- The web page will have multiple objects(HTML, CSS, png, etc.) referenced using URL
	- URL:
		- Defined in [RFC 3986](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986)
		- Short sequence of characters used to identify resources in the internet
- What happens when we visit a website?
	- Assume the client already has the server address
	- The client sends a connection request to the web server
	- The server responds with an ack message if it accepts the connection
	- The client sends the request for the base html file
	- The server sends the base html file as response
	- The client receives the base html page and requests the resources that are referenced in the base html page
	- The server sends these resources
#### 1.1 Non persistent TCP connection with no parallel connections
- In HTTP 1.1 non persistent tcp connections were used
- Each object is sent over a separate TCP connection
- HTTP uses three way hand shake 
	- Client -> Server : TCP SYN
	- Server -> Client : TCP SYN ACK
	- Client -> Server : TCP ACK, HTTP Req(piggy backed)
- 1 RTT to establish connection as the third packet is set along with the http request
- 1 RTT + File transmission delay is required to transfer the file
- Total time to receive a file: 2 RTT
#### 1.2 Non persistent TCP connection with parallel TCP connection
- Each object still requires a separate TCP Connection, but multiple TCP connections are established at once
