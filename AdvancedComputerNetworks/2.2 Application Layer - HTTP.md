### Transport services provided by Internet
- Guarantees 
	- Reliable data transfer
- Does not guarantee
	- Through put
	- Delay
		- Even if the internet services does not provide timing guarantees, a lot of applications use the internet transport layer serves. 
		- This is because the delay is minimized using CDN. By making the content available closer to the user
	- Security
		- The security measures should be implemented by other protocols such as TLS

### 1. HTTP
- Where is this protocol defined? [RFC 9112](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9112) [RFC 9113](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9113)
- Client and server use the HTTP protocol to communicate
- Characteristics
	- Stateless protocol
		- Each req/res in HTTP is independent of each other
	- Uses TCP as underlying protocol
- What is defined in the protocol
	- The syntax of the request and responses
	- The semantics 
- Terminology
	- Web page
		- The web page will have multiple objects(HTML, CSS, png, etc.) referenced using URL
	- URL:
		- Defined in [RFC 3986](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986)
		- Short sequence of characters used to identify resources in the internet and locate the resource
			- URLs are a subset of URI
			- URI are universal resource identifiers
			- URI is used to locate a resource. More generic and not limited to the internet
- What happens when we visit a website?
	- Assume the client already has the server address
	- The client sends a connection request to the web server
	- The server responds with an ack message if it accepts the connection
	- The client sends the request for the base html file
	- The server sends the base html file as response
	- The client receives the base html page 
		- Parses the entire base html, then requests additional resources referenced in the base html
	- The server sends these resources

### 2. HTTP Versions 
#### 2.1 Non persistent TCP with no parallel connections
- In HTTP 1.1 non persistent tcp connections were used
- Each object is sent over a separate TCP connection
- HTTP uses three way hand shake 
	- Client -> Server : TCP SYN
	- Server -> Client : TCP SYN ACK
	- Client -> Server : TCP ACK, HTTP req(piggy backed)
- 1 RTT to establish connection as the third packet is set along with the http request
- 1 RTT + File transmission delay is required to transfer the file
- Total time to receive a file: 2 RTT
#### 2.2 Non persistent TCP connection with parallel TCP connection
- Each object still requires a separate TCP Connection, but multiple TCP connections are established at once 
#### 2.3 Persistent TCP without pipelining  
- Over the same TCP connection multiple objects can be sent
- Each object is requested and sent sequentially
- Example
	- In this case, the client requests object 1, waits for server to send the object 1.
	- Once object 1 is received, client requests object 2
	- In the persistent TCP connection, all the objects are sent on the same connection
#### 2.4 Persistent TCP with pipelining
- Over the same connection, send multiple requests and responses in burst
- Example:
	- Client requests the base HTML
	- The server sends the base HTML
	- If there 10 objects in the base HTML, client sends 10 requests at once, the server sends all the objects at once 
	- Each object is sent in fcfs, only after the object for the first request is sent, the second object can be sent
 - Cons
	 - As each object is sent in fcfs, head of line blocking occurs
	 - If the first object needs to be fetched from another server, the delay to send the first object increases, therefore increasing the delay for subsequent objects
#### 2.5 Persistent TCP with pipelining and parallel connections
- Open multiple parallel persistent TCP connections with pipelining
#### 2.6 HTTP2
- Issues with HTTP 1
	- Head of line blocking
		- In HTTP 1, FCFS is used to send the objects. If the second object is blocked until the first object is received by the client
	- Plain text protocol
		- In HTTP1, the plain text is converted to binary using ascii values
		- This is inefficient
		- Example: For HTTP Method (GET, PUT, POST, DELETE, HEAD), HTTP 1 will convert the GET into ascii and send it over the internet
			- Instead we can have a Method binary array: each bit combination will be HTTP method, this will be a binary protocol rather than a text protocol
	- Server serves files in FCFS
		- Client cannot set a priority for the object it requests
	- Using multiple parallel TCP connection for a single webpage
		- This makes the server to maintain more socket per client
		- TCP limits the packet size based on the number of connections. Having more TCP connection is beneficial, this will make sure we send more packets. 
		- HTTP 2 tries to eliminate the need of multiple connections
- HTTP 2 Characteristics
	- Binary protocol
	- Multiplexing and Framing 
		- Head of line blocking is prevented by framing
		- Framing: Each obj is split into frames even before sending to the underlying network layer
		- Each of these frames can be sent to the socket in round robin fashion
		- Each http header is contained in single frame, the data is split into multiple frames
		- The framing process is transparent to the http server and http client
	- Client can set priorities for the objects it requires 
	- Enable server push
		- Instead of client requesting each object, the server sends all the object when the client request the base html
		- The server maintainers can look at the analytics of which objects are requested together and make the server send those objects without the client requesting all those objects
	- Cons in HTTP 2
		- In HTTP 2, each frame is sent sequentially. Frame 2 is sent to the client only if frame 1 is successfully received by the client. 
		- This head of line blocking occurs at TCP level. When one frame is sent, TCP will send the next frame only if the client receives the first frame successfully
		- This problem will be addressed in HTTP 3 

### 3. HTTP formats
- HTTP request format
	- Request line
		- HTTP_METHOD Resource_URL HTTP_Version 
	- Headers line
		- Host (URL to locate the server)
			- This will be required for web proxy caches
		- Language accepted
		- Response format accepted
		- Keep connection alive
	- Request body
- HTTP response format
	- Response line
		- HTTP status code
	- Header line
		- Server 
		- Date
		- Content type
		- Content length 
		- Last modified field 
		- Cache response
	- Response body

### 4. Using Cookies to maintain state for HTTP 
- HTTP is stateless, but state might be required in some cases
	- Example. It is useful to maintain a state var, that indicates that a user is logged in. If this state is not maintained, the user will need to login each time they visit the website
- The state can be maintained using cookies
	- Cookies are built on top of HTTP
	- The server has the ability to set or delete the cookies in a client using HTTP headers
	- The client stores these cookies and sends them for each request to the server
- Sequence of message exchanged between client and server
	- Client sends http request to server
	- Server checks if client request has cookies
		- If no cookie, add set-cookie header to http response
	- Client receives http response
		- When set-cookie header is preset, the client browser will store this cookie 
	- Client sends another request to server
		- This time the client sends the cookie along with the http request
	- Server receives the http request with cookie
		- Server has a database to store these cookies, server can then perform validation or any user specific updates
		- Server sends a normal http response
	- Client receives the http response
#### 4.1 Using cookies for tracking   
- 1<sup>st</sup> cookies are necessary to maintain the user state
- Let the client visit website: amazon.com 
- The cookies set by amazon server are first party cookies
- Let the base html sent by amazon server has resources in a server that is not owned by amazon(usually a tracker). 
- The client sends the request to this third party server, with a referrer tag amazon
- **Third Party cookie:** The third party server will create a cookie and use the set-cookie to store it in client. The third party server will have this cookie associated with the websites visited by the client 
- Let's say instagram also uses the same tracker. Now that the client already has the cookie of the third party server(created when visiting amazon), the client will send this cookie
	- The tracker can now add a new entry saying that this client(identified by the cookie) has visited instagram.
- Preventing tracking:
	- Do not store third party cookies in the client browser
	- Cookie jars(partitioning): cookie for amazon will be sent only to amazon
	- Send a do not track request
- Cookies are not the only way to track a user. A server can use device finger printing using IP to track a user
	- To prevent this we can use proxy servers

### 5. Caching HTTP responses
#### 5.1. Proxy/web caches  
- Instead of the client sending the response directly, the request is sent to a proxy server
- The proxy server checks if the object of the host is already cached. If not the proxy request the objects to the server
- The server can control what objects are
	- Cached in local cache (cached at client)
	- Cached publicly (cached in public proxy)
	- Which cached objects needs to be requested again before sending to the client(A conditional GET is used for these objects)
		- The http request will have the field, if-modified-since
		- The server checks this field, if not modified, the server will only send a not modified response. This message is small, the transmission delay can be ignored 
		- How does the client set the if-modified-since field? This is set using the last-modified field present in the first http response from the server
- The multiple clients use a proxy server. The proxy server forwards the requests on behalf of the clients
- Cons
	- When TLS is used, the proxy cannot know the host that the client connects to or the resource the client requires(Because this will be encrypted)
	- This issue is addressed using the HTTP connect method #TODO-EXTRA 
#### 5.2. Reverse proxy
- When client tries to connect to a web server, instead of connecting to the origin web server, client connects to a reverse proxy
- This reverse proxy hides multiple servers from the client
- The caching can be done by the reverse proxy, the reverse proxy can also choose which origin server that will server the client request
- The reverse proxy and origin web servers are maintained by the same org. 
- Using this reverse proxy, load balancing can also be done. Using TLS proto will not affect the reverse proxy as the client directly connects to the reverse proxy

### 6. Analyzing web performance
#### 6.1. Core web vitals
- Largest Contentful Paint
	- How fast the page is visible in viewport
	- Metrics: 75% of the page loads within 2.5 seconds
	- First Contentful Paint
		- Time from start of request to first content appearing on screen
		- Metric: time should be within 1.8 seconds
	- Render blocking resources
		- Resources that prevent the rendering of the first paint unless the resource is fetched
	- LCP Priority and LCP discoverability
		- Set high priority to LCP content to fetch it first
		- Set discoverability to let the browser to know that the content needs to be rendered first
	- LCP Preloading
	- LCP lazy loading
		- Delay non-critical resources to load later
- Cumulative Layout shift
	- How much the webpage contents move when the page elements are being rendered
- First Input Delay
	- Time taken for user input after the webpage has completely rendered
	- 75% of the navigation takes less than 100 ms
	- Total Blocking time
		- Time between first contentful paint and first input delay
- Interaction to next paint
	- Time to render the next paint for a given user input 
- Long tasks
	- Scripts that block the main thread that prevents it from receiving user input
