### 1. Network application architecture
- Client server
	- Client and server communicates
	- Clients cannot communicate with each other
- Peer to peer architecture
	- No central server, each host is called a peer
	- all peers can communicate with each other directly

### 2. Process to Process communication 
- Process on the same system
	- Use inter process communication 
	- IPC can be achieved using sockets
- Process on different systems
	- Send data through network
	- Process sends data to sockets with appropriate meta data to reach the other process 

### 3. Services available to applications
- The services to consider before choosing a transport layer protocol
	- Reliable data transfer
	- Throughput
	- Timing
	- Security
- Services provided by the internet's transport layer protocols
	- TCP
		- Connection oriented
		- Reliable data transfer
	- UDP
		- Connectionless
		- Provides no other guarantee 
		- Light weight protocol

#### 4. How does a processes access the underlying network functionalities?
- The sockets API is used to access the network functionalities
