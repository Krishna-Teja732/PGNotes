### 1. P2P


### 2. CDN 


### 3. Google global network reliability
- **Connecting user to network**
	- Using ISP caches
	- ISP peers with google
		- Request served from edge servers(closer to user, smaller data center)
		- Request served from core servers
- **Managing a large network using SDN** 
	- Enforce reliability using redundancy
	- SDN tool (BwE - bandwidth enhancer)

#### 3.1 Providing reliability
1. Control plane design
2. Network provisioning
	- Forecasting demand for each service and lay networking resources to meet demand of each service 
	- Network design and optimization is done using AI tools
		- Inputs: traffic forecasts, physical infra, failure rate and costs
		- Policies: 
		- Output: Network topology
3. Data enforcement
	- Admission control using Bandwidth allocator(BwE), SIGCOMM 2015)
	- Each service requires different bandwidths 
	- But each service has different priorities and affects the customers differently(using tcp is not sufficient) 
	- Based on policy, BwE allocates the bandwidth at the end hosts based on the priority
4. distributed SDN ([SIGCOMM]() 2024)
5. Network management 

#### 3.2 Control plane design: building large SDN
- Types of traffic
	- Customer traffic(B2 WAN)
		- Low latency and low volume traffic
	- Internal traffic to google(B4 WAN)
		- High volume traffic
		- Traffic consists of replication data 
- SDN
	- Data plane
	- Real time network model
		- Abstraction of the network
	- Controller
		- Admission control(manages provisioning resources)
		- Routing 

#### 3.3 Distributed SDN (SIGCOMM 2024) 
- Motivation
	- Complex architecture of SDN
	- SDN controller requires out of band network( #TODO)
		- Requires a separate control plane network
- Approach: decentralized SDN
	- Run SDN controller on routers using docker

#### 3.5 Network management (MALT tool)
- Challenges: scale, safety and deployment 
- MALT
	- model network topology at different OSI layer 


### 4. AI in networking
- Using natural language for dashboard queries
- Using generative AI for debugging network failures
