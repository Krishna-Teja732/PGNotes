### 1. Network Edge
- End systems aka hosts that connect to the internet via access networks
- End systems run application programs (example: email server/client)
- general types of end systems: Client and server

#### 1.1 Evaluating the performance of a network link
- Bandwidth:
	- Bandwidth = frequency upper bound - frequency lower bound
	- Proportional to capacity
- Transmission rate:
	- How much data can be sent over the link per unit time
	- This is the time the NIC takes to encode the data and send it over the link
- Link capacity:
	- Shannon Link capacity = bandwidth \* log<sub>2</sub>(1 + Signal to noise ratio)
#### 1.2 What are access networks? 
- Connects the end systems to the nearest gateway router
	- Gateway router connects to other ISPs
- Types of access networks
	- DSL - digital subscriber line
		- The telephone link is shared for voice calls and internet. This is a dedicated link from telephone company office to the end user's home
		- The link is shared using frequency division multiplexing
		- Voice only requires less bandwidth (B1 is the least )
		- More bandwidth is allocated to down link (B2 is the highest)
		- Less bandwidth is allocated to up link
	- Cable internet access
		- Uses coaxial cables to connect homes to fiber optic nodes, and fiber optic cables to connect telecom company and fiber optic nodes 
		- Uses frequency division multiplexing
		- Some bandwidth is allocated to transmitting tv channels, rest is allocated for data
		- Each coaxial cable is shared by multiple users
	- Fiber to the home
		- Uses fiber optic cables 
		- One fiber cable from the internet provider which is split into multiple cables that connects to each house
	- Satellite network
		- Uses radio waves
		- Two types
			- Geo stationery satellites: It is located further away from earth, hence has high propagation delay. Few satellites are sufficient for coverage
			- Low earth orbit satellites: closer to earth, lower propagation delay. Many satellites are required for coverage
	- Ethernet, WiFi
		- Ethernet switch connects to different end systems
		- Switch is also connected to a router
	- Wide area wireless networks: 3G and LTE
		- Uses Ultra high frequency waves in the radio waves
		- Wave length is proportional to the penetration depth 
		- Higher the bandwidth, higher link capacity. [Radio spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_spectrum)
