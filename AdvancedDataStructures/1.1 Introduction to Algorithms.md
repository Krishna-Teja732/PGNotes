### 1. What is an Algorithm
- A finite sequence of instructions that transforms the give input to an output
- There are different classes of algorithms
- Algorithms
	- Deterministic Algorithms
	- Randomized Algorithms
		- Las Vegas Algorithms
			- This class of algorithms approach the solution using some form of randomization to get a better expected time
			- These algorithms always produce the correct answer
			- An example for this algorithm is Randomized Quick sort. The pivot is picked at random, but the final array is always in the sorted order. If we are luck with the pivot point, we get a better run time.
		- Monte Carlo Algorithms
			- These algorithms also use randomization to solve the problem, but these algorithms do not always produce the correct answer
			- For example, The min cut size to make a connected graph into two disjoint subgraph can be found using a randomized algorithm.
				- The algorithm outputs the correct answer with certain probability, the probability can be increased using more independent iterations of the algorithm
			- Another example is for Polynomial Identity testing. The algo picks a random point and checks if the output of both polynomials are equal. Repeating this for multiple randomly picked points increases the probability of getting the right answer
#### 1.1 Characteristics of an Deterministic Algorithm
- Correctness of an algorithm: 
	- The algorithm stops and outputs the correct value for any given input 
- Definiteness
	- Each step of the algorithm should be unambiguous
- Minimizing the use of resources
	- Minimizing the resource utilization in desirable in an algorithm
	- Resource can be memory, time to compute, number of processor cores or number of API calls etc
- An algorithm should be deterministic
	- The algorithm will output the same value for the same input value
	- The algorithm terminates for all given inputs
	- The path the algorithm takes can be determined and is same of the same input
	- Exception: Randomized algorithms do not have a deterministic output
- An algorithm should be efficient
	- An algorithm efficiency should be denoted in a format that is hardware independent. (Using asymptotic notations)
