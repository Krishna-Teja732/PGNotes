### 1. Steps in divide and conquer algorithms
- **Divide** the problem into sub-problems
- **Conquer**: Solve the smaller sub-problem
- **Combine** the smaller solved sub-problem to get the final solution  

### 2. Finding complexity of recursive programs
- **How to represent the number of operations?** 
	- Using recurrence relations
- **How to get the asymptotic notation from the recurrence relation?**
	- Substitution 
	- Recursion tree
	- Master's theorem ![](./Attachments/masters_theorem.png)

### 3. Examples 
#### 3.1 Finding maximum subarray
- Given an array A[0 ... N] of size N, where A[i] is an integer. Find the subarray with the maximum sum.
- **Divide**
	- Divide the problem into two halves
- **Conquer**
	- If the problem size is 1, then it the maximum subarray
- **Combine**
	- find the maximum{result of left half, result of right half, max sub array between left half and right half}
	- For A[low ... high] and mid = (low + high)/2
		- The maximum subarray lies in A[low ... mid]
		- The maximum subarray lies in A[mid+1 ... high]
		- The maximum subarray lies in A[low ... mid]
			- This can be converted to the sum of max subarray from <br> A[i ... mid] + A[mid+1 ... j] 
			- This takes linear time
- **Time complexity**:
	- Recurrence relation: T(n) = 2T(n/2) + n 
	- Time complexity: $\theta(n\log(n))$
