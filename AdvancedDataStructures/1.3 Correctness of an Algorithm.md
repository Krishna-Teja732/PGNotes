### 1. Correctness of an algorithm
- To prove if an algorithm produces a correct output for all possible inputs, we could use loop invariants and mathematical proofs

#### 1.1 Loop Invariant
- We find a invariant for a loop in the algorithm, the invariant is represented in predicate logic
- To show an algo is correct using an invariant, the following criteria are satisfied
	- Initialization
		- The loop invariant is true before the loop starts
	- Maintenance
		- If the loop invariant is true before the current iteration of the loop then the loop invariant must be true before the next iteration
		- This step can be proved using mathematical induction. The base case will be the initialization step. The if the invariant is true for some iteration i, prove that it is true for the   (i+1)<sup>th</sup> iteration
	- Terminations
		- When loop terminates, the invariant should hold true. It should also provide info that can be used to show the correctness of an algorithm

### 2. Loop invariant Examples
#### 2.1 Loop invariant for insertion sort
- Given an array of elements A[1 ... N], the array is sorted if A[1] <=A[2] <=A[3] ... <= A[N]
```
Insertion sort(A[1 ... N])
	j = 2
	while j < N
		i = j - 1
		key = A[j]
		while i >= 0 and A[i] > key
			A[i+1] = A[i]
			i = i - 1
		j = j + 1
```
- **Loop invariant for insertion sort:**
	- At start of each iteration, the subarray A[1 ... j-1] will contains the elements from A[1 ... j-1] and the subarray A[1 ... j-1] will be in sorted order
- **Initialization**
	- Before the start of the loop, j = 2, A[1 ... j-1] will contain only A[1]. The single element is already in sorted order 
- **Maintenance**
	- At the end of the inner while loop, the j<sup>th</sup> element will be stored in the correct place
	- Incrementing j will not invalidate the loop invariant
- **Termination**
	- At the end of the loop, j = N + 1. the invariant states that the  array A[1 ... N] is in sorted order
#### 2.2 Loop invariant for linear search
- Given an array of elements A[1 ... N] and a number v, the algorithm returns the index i where A[i] = v, if there is no such element in A, the index is NIL
```
LinearSearch(A[1 ... N]):
	i = 1
	reulat = NIL
	while i < N
		if A[i] == v
			result = i;
			return
		i = i + 1
```
- **Loop Invariant** 
	- At start of each iteration, result = NIL if A[1, i - 1] does not contain v, else result = i
- **Initialization**
	- Before the start of the loop, i = 1, A[1, 0] contain zero elements. Invariant holds true 
- **Maintenance**
	- Case A: for index k A[k] != v
		- increment k = k + 1
		- A[1 ... k] does not contain v
	- Case B: for index k A[k] == v
		- result = k
- **Termination**
	- Case A: array does not contain v
		- Invariant result = NIL, A[1 ... N] does not contain v
	- Case B: array contains v 
		- Invariant result = i then, A[i] = v
