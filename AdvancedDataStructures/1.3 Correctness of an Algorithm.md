### 1. Correctness of an algorithm
- To prove if an algorithm produces a correct output for all possible inputs, one of the following methods can be used

#### 1.1 Loop Invariant
- We find a invariant for a loop in the algorithm, the invariant is represented in predicate logic 
- The invariant should be true in the beginning and the end of the loop
- The loop needs to terminate with the invariant still being true
