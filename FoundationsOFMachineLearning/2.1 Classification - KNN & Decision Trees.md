#### 1. KNN classifier
- Non-parametric, transductive, discriminative model
- No training involved, just store the data points
- Steps for prediction
	- Compute the distance between the new point and every other point in data
	- The argmax(distance(new point, data point))
		- Find the class of K closest points to the new data point
		- The majority of the class of these K points will be the predicted class of the new data point
- To determine K, start with K = 1 and increment K by 2, out of these values of K use the K value with least error
- To improve the KNN algo
	- Always normalize the data
	- Use distance weighted voting to determine the class 

### 2. Decision Trees
- Non parametric, transductive, discriminative model 
- Types
	- Univariate
		- At each level split based on one attribute
	- Multivariate
		- At each level split based on multiple attributes 
- How to choose the attribute to make the split
