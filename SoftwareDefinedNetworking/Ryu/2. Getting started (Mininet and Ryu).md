### 1. Mininet
- Simulate a network 
- The topology is written in python
#### 1.1 Installing mininet
- Mininet requires open flow switch to run, install [openvswitch](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Open_vSwitch) arch package and enable the ovs-vswitchd.service
- Install the mininet package from AUR
- [Mininet walkthrough](https://mininet.org/walkthrough/#part-1-everyday-mininet-usage)
#### 1.2 Specifying a topology in python
```python
from mininet.topo import Topo
from mininet.link import TCLink

class LinearTopo(Topo):

    def build(self):
        s1 = self.addSwitch('s1')
        s2 = self.addSwitch('s2')

        h1 = self.addHost('h1')
        h2 = self.addHost('h2')

        self.addLink(s1, s2, cls = TCLink, delay='100ms', loss=5)
        self.addLink(s1, h1, cls = TCLink, delay='10ms', loss=0)
        self.addLink(s2, h2, cls = TCLink, delay='20ms', loss=0)


topos = {'LinearTopo': (lambda: LinearTopo())}
```
- The above code shows 2 hosts connected by 2 switched in between them
- `TCLink` can used to specify the link delay, loss and bandwidth (bw)
- The topos variable should be a dict with all Topos 
- To run this topo
```sh
sudo mn --custom topos.py --topo LinearTopo --switch ovsk
```
- To run this topo with a different controller 
```sh
sudo mn --custom topos.py --topo LinearTopo --switch ovsk --controller remote,ip=127.0.0.1,port=10001
```
- #TODO: 
	- Setup X11 server to use in mininet host terminal()
	- Creating a mininet class obj to run the net
	- Controller application can be run in mininet command line
	- The default ofp is 1 in mininet, learn how to specify a different proto

### 2. Ryu Controller 
- A ryu application is a python script that controls how the switches are configured
- Reference for ofp parser functions: [Ryu ofp_v_1 ofp_parser functions](https://ryu.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ofproto_v1_0_ref.html)
- Tasks - [Code examples](https://github.com/Krishna-Teja732/NetworksProject)
	- Simple switch, that sends all packets to the controller, controller instructs switch to flood all packets
	- Simple switch v2, controller configures switch to flood all packets
	- Simple Learning switch
		- Add flow rule to send packet when no rules match
		- For each incoming data packet, store the src mac address and in port
		- If the dst mac address is already know, we know the port to which to forward the packet
		- Set a flow rule to the switch to forward packet to port based on the dst mac address 
		- Maintain the mac to port dict only for one switch
	- Learning switch v_2 
		- Same as simple learning switch, but maintain the mac to port dict for multiple switches
