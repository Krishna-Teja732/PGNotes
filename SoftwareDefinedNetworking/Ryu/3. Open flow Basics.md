### 1. Open flow switch basics
- Defines what functionalities the switch must provide
- Defines the messages exchanged between the controller and the switch(i.e. open flow is a Northbound API)
- How does the controller and switch communicate
	- **Secure channel**:
		- The open flow switch and the controller is connected by a secure channel
		- **Datapath ID**: Unique ID for each logical open flow switch
		- The messages sent through the secure channel will be formatted based on open flow protocol
#### 1.1 Components of a Open Flow Switch(ofs):
- Each switch has a **single flow table in ofp v_1_0**
- Each flow table will have **flow entries** 
	- When a packet matches none of the entries, forward the packet to the controller
- Each flow entry will consist of 
		- Each **flow rule** matches the header fields and performs an action
			- The headers that can be matched for Open flow v1 can be found here: [Ryu ofp_v_1_0 Match Structure](https://ryu.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ofproto_v1_0_ref.html#flow-match-structure)
	- When there are multiple rules that match for a packet, perform the action of the **highest priority** flow rule
	- **List of action**:
		- Each flow rule will have an associated **List of actions**
		- The actions that can be performed for ofp_v_1_0 can be found here : [Ryu ofp_v_1_0 action structures](https://ryu.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ofproto_v1_0_ref.html#action-structures)
		- Example: forward, add/remove vlan id, set src/dst MAC address
	- **Empty Action list**
		- Drop packet
	- Buffers maintained to store **statistics for a flow rule**
		- Each flow rule will have a **timer**:
			- Timer tracks the time since the flow rule was configured
			- Each **flow rule can be removed based on timeout**
				- **Idle timeout** = remove flow rule only if it did not match to any packet for a certain time interval 
				- **Hard timeout** = remove flow rule after certain interval even if it was not idle
		- Number of packets that matched the flow rule
		- Number of bytes that was matched for the flow rule 
			- number of packets that matched the flow rule x size of packet
- **Counters per table**
- **Counters per port** 

### 2. Types of open flow messages
#### 2.1 Controller to switch messages
- **Initiated by controller**
- Types: 
	- **Feature request**
		- Switch replies with the features supported
	- **Configuration**
		- Configure switch 
	- **Modify state**
		- Add/Delete flow table entries
	- **Read state**
		- Get statistics of flow table entries
	- **Send packet**
		- Instructs switch to send packet to specific port
	- **Barrier**
		- Notification when operation is completed
		- #TODO 

#### 2.2 Async messages
- Sent by the switch
- Types
	- **Packet IN**
		- **Triggering event** Packet did not match any flow table entries, or flow entry action is to send to switch
		- **Buffering packets**
			- If switch supports buffering, buffer packet and send only first 128 bytes of the packet
			- If switch does not support buffering, switch sends entire packet to the controller
		- **Buffer IDs**
			- The controller can specify only the buffer id if the switch supports buffering
	- **Flow removed**
		- **Triggering event:** flow rule is removed because of idle,hard timeout or by a flow modify message 
	- **Port status**:
		- **Triggering event:** port status changed
	- **Error**
		- **Triggering event**: Error at the switch 

#### 2.3 Symmetric messages
- Types
	- **Hello messages**
		- Exchanged between controller and switch on startup
	- **Echo**: 
		- Sent by the switch or controller, the receiver should always send a echo reply	
	- **Vendor**
		- #TODO 

### 1. Open flow 1.3
- Uses **multiple flow tables** to form a pipeline
	- Table id 0 will be executed first
	- Table id 255 will be executed last
- Table miss entry:
	- For each table a miss entry can be set
	- If **no miss** entry is present, **packet is dropped**
	- The **miss entry** matches all fields and has priority 0
- **Flow remove message**
	- Switch sends flow removed message only if the OFPFF_SEND_FLOW_REMM flag is set for the flow entry
	- Contains the flow entry, flow entry stat, reason for deleting flow entry
- ofp Flow Mod uses **instructions** instead of a actions
	- Apply action set
	- Clear all actions in the action set 
	- Write action: merges current set of actions with existing actions
	- Goto table: specifies with table to go to
